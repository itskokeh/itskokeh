## Hey, Iâ€™m Kokeh ðŸ‘‹

I like figuring things out and writing about it.

Most of the stuff I do revolves around web development (mostly JavaScript),
privacy-conscious tools, and making my workflow as clean and efficient as
possible. I'm a fan of open-source software, simple UIs, and the kind of code
that feels satisfying to write and maintain.

Right now, Iâ€™m deep in the full-stack rabbit hole, slowly moving from frontend
comfort to backend challenges. I use Git a lotâ€”like, a *lot*â€”and I even treat
GitHub like a second brain sometimes. Notes, code, experimentsâ€¦ it all lives here
somewhere.

When Iâ€™m not coding, I might be writing something for my blog (currently on
Substack, soon moving to something static and hacker-friendly like Astro),
or just tinkering with tools to make my setup feel more *mine*.

No real agenda hereâ€”just building, learning, breaking things, and writing about
it as I go.

If you poke around, youâ€™ll probably find:

- unfinished side projects
- small tools to scratch my own itch
- notes that should be blog posts
- the occasional README written way too late

Feel free to explore, fork, or just drop a comment if something resonates.

ðŸ›  Things Iâ€™ve worked on:

- Helped out with open source docs here and there â€” like this one on
  [neostandard](https://github.com/neostandard/neostandard/pull/268).
  I actually enjoy writing documentation (kinda underrated, tbh).
- Currently working on a note-taking app that syncs with GitHub, inspired by my
  own workflow

Stay curious ðŸ§
